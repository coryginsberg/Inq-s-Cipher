# Inq's Cipher Wheel (Kinda)


*This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).*

Based on the Cipher Wheel as shown in [this episode of *Michael's Toys*](https://youtu.be/TvsiLV7RLx4) hosted by Michael Stevens of [Vsause](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6nSFpj9HTCZ5t-N3Rm3-HA).

*Note: Inq is not mine and was created by the guys at Vsause for the Curiosity Box. I'm simply using Inq because the original inspiration for this was called Inq's Cipher Wheel in the video and because Inq is adorable. Please don't sue me.*
